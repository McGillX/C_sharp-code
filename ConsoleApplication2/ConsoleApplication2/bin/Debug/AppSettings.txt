//PATH_LOCATION is the folder containing the tracking logs (tracking logs can be in subfolders - that's okay)
//Must be set for CHOICE value of logs

//DISCUSSION_PATH is the folder containing the -prod.mongo MONGO files

//If the connection died mid-upload, set the three values below.
//1) Find the DeadConnections file (location set by DEAD_CONNECTION_FILE below)
//2) Find the name of the last file read, and last line read
//3) Set those values below, and set LOAD_FROM_CRASH as true
//4) Remember to reset LOAD_FROM_CRASH to false when done!
